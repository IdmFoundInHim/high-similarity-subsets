# Equal-Sum-Subset

Sorts set _K_ into subsets _K<sub>n</sub>_ with each set
_K<sub>n</sub>_ having equal (or nearly equal) sum and equal
cardinality.

Mathmatically,

* (#_K_) / _n_ = (#_K<sub>x</sub>_) where 0 ≤ _x_ ≤ _n_
* $$\frac{\#K}{n} = \#K_x, 0 \le x \le n$$
* $$\sum{K_0} \approxeq \sum{K_1} \approxeq ...$$
    * Preferably $=$ rather than $\approx$
